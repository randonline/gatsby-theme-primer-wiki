Clone the repo locally:\n\n   `git clone https://github.com/foambubble/foam.git`\n\n2. Install the necessary dependencies by running this command from the root:\n\n   `yarn install`\n\n3. This project uses [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/). `foam-vscode` relies on `foam-core`. This means we need to compile it before we do any extension development. From the root, run the command:\n\n   `yarn build`\n\nYou should now be ready to start working!\n\n### Testing\n\nCode needs to come with tests.\nWe use the following convention in Foam:\n\n- \\*.test.ts are unit tests\n- \\*.spec.ts are integration tests\n\nAlso, note that tests in `foam-core` live in the `test` directory.\nTests in `foam-vscode` live alongside the code in `src`.\n\n### The VS Code Extension\n\nThis guide assumes you read the previous instructions and you're set up to work on Foam.\n\n1. Now we'll use the launch configuration defined at [`.vscode/launch.json`](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/blob/master/.vscode/launch.json) to start a new extension host of VS Code. Open the \"Run and Debug\" Activity (the icon with the bug on the far left) and select \"Run VSCode Extension\" in the pop-up menu. Now hit F5 or click the green arrow \"play\" button to fire up a new copy of VS Code with your extension installed.\n\n2. In the new extension host of VS Code that launched, open a Foam workspace (e.g. your personal one, or a test-specific one created from [foam-template](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template)). This is strictly not necessary, but the extension won't auto-run unless it's in a workspace with a `.vscode/foam.json` file.\n\n3. Test a command to make sure it's working as expected. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and select \"Foam: Update Markdown Reference List\". If you see no errors, it's good to go!\n\n---\n\nFeel free to modify and submit a PR if this guide is out-of-date or contains errors!\n\n---\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[principles]: principles.md \"Principles\"\n[code-of-conduct]: code-of-conduct.md \"Code of Conduct\"\n[architecture]: dev/architecture.md \"Architecture\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/frequently-asked-questions/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - FAQ\n---\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n> ⚠️ Foam is still in preview.

Create a single **Foam** workspace for all your knowledge and research following the [Getting started](#getting-started) guide.\n2. Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them **Bubbles**, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. ([source](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles))\n3. Use Foam's shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with `[[wikilinks]]`, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.\n4. Get an overview of your **Foam** workspace using a [[graph-visualisation]] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [[backlinking]].\n\nFoam is a like a bathtub: _What you get out of it depends on what you put into it._\n\n## What's in a Foam?\n\nLike the soapy suds it's named after, **Foam** is mostly air.\n\n1. The editing experience of **Foam** is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [[recommended-extensions]] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.\n2. To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with [GitHub](http://github.com/).\n3. To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or to any website hosting platform like [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com).\n\n> **Fun fact**: This documentation was researched, written and published using **Foam**.\n\n## Getting started\n\n> ⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.\n\nThese instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.\n\n1. Use the [foam-template project](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template) to generate a new repository. If you're logged into GitHub, you can just hit this button:\n\n   <a class=\"github-button\" href=\"https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate\" data-icon=\"octicon-repo-template\" data-size=\"large\" aria-label=\"Use this template foambubble/foam-template on GitHub\">Use this template</a>\n\n   _If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private, or if you don't want to use GitHub to host your workspace at all, choose [**Download as ZIP**](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/archive/master.zip) instead of **Use this template**._\n\n2. [Clone the repository locally](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open it in VS Code.\n\n   _Open the repository as a folder using the `File > Open...` menu item. In VS Code, \"open workspace\" refers to [multi-root workspaces](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces)._\n\n3. When prompted to install recommended extensions, click **Install all** (or **Show Recommendations** if you want to review and install them one by one)\n\nAfter setting up the repository, open `.vscode/settings.json` and edit, add or remove any settings you'd like for your Foam workspace.\n\nTo learn more about how to use **Foam**, read the [[recipes]].\n\nGetting stuck in the setup? Read the [[frequently-asked-questions]].\n\nCheck our [issues on GitHub](http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) if you get stuck on something, and create a new one if something doesn't seem right!\n\n## Features\n\n**Foam** doesn't have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [[recommended-extensions]] you choose to install, but it's up to you to discover what you can do with it!\n\n![Short video of Foam in use](assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif)\n\nHead over to [[recipes]] for some useful patterns and ideas!\n\n## Call To Adventure\n\nThe goal of **Foam** is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.\n\nIt's currently about \"10% ready\" relative to all the features I've thought of, but I've only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I'm excited to learn from others.\n\nI am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.\n\nIf that sounds like something you're interested in, I'd love to have you along on the journey.\n\n- Read about our [[principles]] to understand Foam's philosophy and direction\n- Read the [[contribution-guide]] guide to learn how to participate.\n- Feel free to open [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues) to give me feedback and ideas for new features.\n\n**Foam** was inspired by [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and the [Zettelkasten methodology](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview)\n\n**Foam** wouldn't be possible without [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), and relies heavily on our fantastic open source [[recommended-extensions]] and all their contributors!\n\n## License\n\nFoam is licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.txt).\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[graph-visualisation]: features/graph-visualisation.md \"Graph Visualisation\"\n[backlinking]: features/backlinking.md \"Backlinking\"\n[recommended-extensions]: recommended-extensions.md \"Recommended Extensions\"\n[recipes]: recipes/recipes.md \"Recipes\"\n[frequently-asked-questions]: frequently-asked-questions.md \"Frequently Asked Questions\"\n[principles]: principles.md \"Principles\"\n[contribution-guide]: contribution-guide.md \"Contribution Guide\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/principles/","title":"Principles"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Principles\n---\n\n# Principles\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Principles](#principles)\n  - [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)\n  - [Foam enables you to do your best thinking](#foam-enables-you-to-do-your-best-thinking)\n  - [Foam wants you to own your thoughts](#foam-wants-you-to-own-your-thoughts)\n  - [Foam helps you share your thoughts with the world.](#foam-helps-you-share-your-thoughts-with-the-world)\n  - [Foam allows people to collaborate in discovering better ways to work, together.](#foam-allows-people-to-collaborate-in-discovering-better-ways-to-work-together)\n  - [Foam is for hackers, not only for programmers](#foam-is-for-hackers-not-only-for-programmers)\n\n## Foam enables you to do your best thinking\n\n- **Foam works for you, you don't work for Foam.** You should be able to focus on your work and not fight against Foam, or having to perform fiddly operations or maintenance jobs to keep Foam happy.\n- **Foam is not a package deal.** You must be able to adopt only the parts of Foam that you want. There must be no tight coupling between Foam's features.\n- **Foam is a starting point** You must be able to customise how foam looks and feels, and combine it with other tools you find helpful in your personal workflow.\n- **Foam is not a philosophy.** Whether you use a methodology like Zettelkasten is up to you. **You should be able to use Foam without joining a cult.**\n\n## Foam wants you to own your thoughts\n\n- **Foam doesn't want your data.** You can store your documents wherever you want. Some of Foam's suggested workflows include GitHub, if you don't want to use it to store your data, or you want to stop using it in the future, you should be able to migrate to alternative storage options. If you choose to not upload your notes to any cloud service or remote repository, remember to keep frequent local and occasional offsite backups of your data!\n- **Foam should not lock you in.** Foam's content files, structure and metadata should be in interoperable format that supports migrating it to another tool if you prefer to. Users of Foam should be able to develop and share such tools freely.\n- **Foam should not leak your secrets.** Nobody, including the developers of Foam, should have access to your personal knowledge graph unless you choose to give it to them. Foams should always be private by default, but [easy to share](#foam-helps-you-share-your-thoughts-with-the-world) if you choose to.\n\n## Foam helps you share your thoughts with the world.\n\nThis principle may seem like it contradicts [Foam wants you to own your thoughts](#foam-wants-you-to-own-your-thoughts), but it's actually a compatible corollary. You should be able to do both, because:\n\n> [...] environments that build walls around good ideas tend to be less innovative in the long run than more open-ended environments. Good ideas may not want to be free, but they do want to connect, fuse, recombine. —_Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From_\n\n- **Foam should make it easy to publish your knowledge graph.** With zero code, you should be able to make your graph public to the world. You should have full control over how it looks, feels, and where it's hosted.\n- **Foam should make it easy to collaborate on ideas.** Foam should allow you to work closely together with your collaborators, and accept feedback, input and improvements from others.\n- **Foam should make it easy to publish what you choose.** Foam should double as a low-barrier blog/publishing platform, so you can share content to an audience without inviting them to intrude on your entire workspace.\n\n## Foam allows people to collaborate in discovering better ways to work, together.\n\n- **Foam is a collection of ideas.** Foam was released to the public not to share the few good ideas in it, but to learn many good ideas from others. As you improve your own workflow, share your work on your own Foam blog.\n- **Foam is open for contributions.** If you use a tool or workflow that you like that fits these principles, please contribute them back to the Foam template as [[recipes]], [[recommended-extensions]] or documentation in [this workspace](https://github.com/foambubble/foam). See also: [[contribution-guide]].\n- **Foam is open source.** Feel free to fork it, improve it and remix it. Just don't sell it, as per our [license](LICENSE.txt).\n- **Foam is not Roam.** This project was inspired by Roam Research, but we're not limited by what Roam does. No idea is too big (though if it doesn't fit with Foam's core workflow, we might make it a [[recipes]] page instead).\n\n## Foam is for hackers, not only for programmers\n\nWhile Foam uses tools popular among computer programmers, Foam should be inclusive of everyone who wants to improve their own workflow to improve themselves.\n\n- **Foam embraces the hacker mindset.** The target audience for Foam are people who look for creative ways to improve their ability to collect and organise information.\n- **Foam is not just for programmers.** If you're a programmer, feel free to write scripts and extensions to support your own workflow, and publish them for others to use, but the out of the box Foam experience should not require you to know how to do so.

To understand why this is the case, we need to understand what we are trading off.\n\nSo, why don't they work on GitHub?\n\nThe three components of [[link-reference-definitions]] are link label, link destination and Link Title.\n\nThe issue is the middle **link destination** component. It's configured to point to the file name **without file extension**, i.e. \"file-name\" instead of \"file-name.md\". This is to make the GitHub Pages rendering work, because if we generated the links to `file-name.md`, the links would point to the raw markdown files instead of their generated HTML versions.\n\n| Environment      | `file-name` | `file-name.md` |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| **VS Code**      | Works       | Works          |\n| **GitHub pages** | Works       | Breaks         |\n| **GitHub UI**    | Breaks      | Works          |\n\nSo as you can see, we've prioritised GitHub Pages over GitHub Web UI for the time being.\n\nIdeally, we'd like a solution that works with both, but it's not defined yet (see [[link-reference-definitions]] for more details)\n\n#### Workaround\n\nFor the time being, you can use relative `[markdown links](markdown-link.md)` syntax.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- This will work on all platforms.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- It will break the Markdown Notes [[backlinking]] support\n- Less convenient to write\n\n### Finding certain words clutter the VS Code search results\n\nSince link reference definitions have `[//begin]` and `[//end]` guards with explanatory text that use certain words, these words (like \"generate\") appear in VS Code search results if you happen to search matching strings from the workspace.\n\n## Improvement Proposal\n\nProblem space in essence:\n\n- During edit-time (when modifying the markdown files in an editor)\n  - link reference definitions are needed if user uses editor extensions that don't understand wikilinks\n  - link reference definitions may be annoying since they\n    - add content to files that the user hasn't typed in by themselves\n    - get out of date if user uses a tool that doesn't autogenerate them\n    - may clutter the search results\n- During build-time (when converting markdown to html for publishing purposes)\n  - link reference definitions are needed, if the files are published via such tools (or to such platforms) that don't understand wikilinks\n  - link reference definitions might have to be in different formats depending on the publish target (e.g. GitHub pages vs GitHub UI)\n\nThe potential solution:\n\n- For edit-time\n  - Make edit-time link reference definition generation optional via user settings. They should be on by default, and generating valid markdown links with a relative path to a `.md` file.\n  - Make format of the link reference definition configurable (whether to include '.md' or not)\n  - Out of recommended extensions, currently only \"markdown links\" doesn't support them (?). However even its [code](https://github.com/tchayen/markdown-links/blob/master/src/parsing.ts#L25) seems to include wikilink parser, so it might just be a bug?\n- For build-time\n\n  - To satisfy mutually incompatible constraints between GitHub UI, VSCode UI, and GitHub Pages, we should add a pre-processing/build step for pushing to GitHub Pages.\n    - This would be a GitHub action (or a local script, ran via foam-cli) that outputs publish-friendly markdown format for static site generators and other publishing tools\n    - This build step should be pluggable, so that other transformations could be ran during it\n  - Have publish targets defined in settings, that support both turning the link reference definitions on/off and defining their format (.md or not). Example draft (including also edit-time aspect):\n\n    ```typescript\n    // settings json\n    // see enumerations below for explanations on values\n    {\n      \"foam\": {\n        \"publish\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Gitlab Mirror\",     // name of the publish target\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"Off\",\n            \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withExtensions\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"GitHub Pages\",\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"Off\",\n            \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withoutExtensions\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"Blog\",\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"Off\",\n            \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"Off\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"name\": \"My Amazing PDF book\",\n            \"linkTranspilation\": \"WikiLinksToMarkdown\"\n          }\n        ],\n        \"edit\": {\n          \"linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"Off\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Defines if and how links in markdown files are somehow converted (in-place) during build time\n    // Note that this enumeration is not valid edit-time, since we (probably) don't want to change text like this while user is editing it\n    enum LinkTranspilation {\n      Off,                   // links are not transpiled\n      WikiLinksToMarkdown,   // links using wiki-format [[link]] are converted to normal md links: [link](./some/file.md)\n                             // if this is set, not link reference definitions are generated (not needed)\n    }\n\n    // Defines if and how link reference definition section is generated\n    enum LinkReferenceDefinitions {\n      Off,               // link reference definitions are not generated\n      WithExtensions,    // link reference definitions contain .md (or similar) file extensions\n      WithoutExtensions  // link reference definitions do not contain file extenions\n    }\n\n    ```\n\n  - With Foam repo, just use edit-time link reference definitions with '.md' extension - this makes the links work in the GitHub UI\n  - Have publish target defined for GitHub pages, that doesn't use '.md' extension, but still has the link reference definitions. Generate the output into gh-pages branch (or separate repo) with automation.\n    - This naturally requires first removing the existing link reference definitions during the build\n\n- Other\n  - To clean up the search results, remove link reference definition section guards (assuming that these are not defined by the markdown spec). Use unifiedjs parse trees to identify if there's missing (or surplus) definitions (check if they are identified properly by the library), and just add the needed definitions to the bottom of the file (without guards) AND remove them if they are not needed (anywhere from the file).\n\nNote that the proposal above supports both (build-time) inline transpilation of wikilinks as well as creation reference definitions. Depending on the direction of Foam, also only one of them could be selected. In that case the other could be implemented at later point of time.\n\nUI-wise, the publish targets could be picked in some similar fashion as the run/debug targets in vscode by implementing a separate panel, or maybe through command execution (CTRL+SHIFT+P) - not yet defined at this point.\n\n## Links\n\n- [tracking issue on GitHub](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/16)\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[wikilinks]: ../wikilinks.md \"Wikilinks\"\n[link-reference-definitions]: ../features/link-reference-definitions.md \"Link Reference Definitions\"\n[backlinking]: ../features/backlinking.md \"Backlinking\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/dev/materialized-backlinks/","title":"Materialized Backlinks (stub)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Dev\n---\n\n# Materialized Backlinks (stub)\n\n**[[todo]] This [[roadmap]] item needs more specification work.**\n\nIf you're interested in working on it, please start a conversation in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues).\n\n## Notes\n\nThe idea would be to automatically generate lists of backlinks (and optionally, also forward links) into the bottom of every markdown document to\n\n- Make every link two-way navigable in published sites\n- Make Foam notes more portable to different apps and long-term storage\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[todo]: todo.md \"Todo\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap.md \"Roadmap\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/dev/mdx-by-default/","title":"MDX by Default(stub)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Dev\n  - Mdx\n---\n\n# MDX by Default(stub)\n\n**[[todo]] This [[roadmap]] item needs more specification work.**\n\nIf you're interested in working on it, please start a conversation in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues).\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[todo]: todo.md \"Todo\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap.md \"Roadmap\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/dev/publishing-permissions/","title":"Publishing Permissions(stub)"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Dev\n---\n\n# Publishing Permissions(stub)\n\n**[[todo]] This [[roadmap]] item needs more specification work.**\n\nIf you're interested in working on it, please start a conversation in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues).\n\n## Notes\n\n- Public and private pages\n- Share specific page (with private hash)\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[todo]: todo.md \"Todo\"\n[roadmap]: roadmap.md \"Roadmap\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/dev/roadmap/","title":"Roadmap"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Dev\n  - Roadmap\n---\n\n# Roadmap\n\nSome of these items can be achieved by combining existing tools, but others may require us to build bespoke software solutions.

You are free to build whatever you want for yourself, and we'd love if you shared it with us, but you are by no means obligated to do so!_\n\n**When creating GitHub issues to discuss roadmap items, link them here.**\n\n### Known issues\n\n- [[improve-default-workspace-settings]]\n  - Discussion: [foam#270](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/270)\n- Improve [[git-integration]]\n- Fix [[wikilinks]] compatibility issues\n- Simplify [[foam-file-format]]\n\n### Core features\n\n- [[renaming-files]]\n- [[unlinked-references]]\n- [[block-references]]\n- [[improved-backlinking]]\n  - UX: [[make-backlinks-more-prominent]]\n- [[materialized-backlinks]]\n- [[automatic-git-syncing]]\n- [[git-flows-for-teams]]\n- [[user-settings]]\n- [[link-reference-definitions]]\n- [[predefined-user-snippets]]\n\n### Publishing\n\n- [[officially-support-alternative-templates]]\n- [[improved-static-site-generation]]\n- [[mdx-by-default]]\n- [[search-in-published-workspace]]\n- [[graph-in-published-workspace]]\n  - Discussion: [foam#58](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/58)\n- [[linking-between-published-workspaces]]\n  - Discussion: [foam#59](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/59)\n- [[publishing-permissions]]\n\n### Platforms\n\n- [[cli]]\n- [[mobile-apps]]\n- [[packaged-desktop-app]]\n- [[web-editor]]\n\n### Migration\n\nThe community is working on a number of automated scripts to help you migrate to Foam.

If a Daily Note for today's date already exists, the command opens the existing note.\n\n![Daily note feature in action](../assets/images/daily-note.gif)\n\n## Keyboard shortcut\n\nThe default keyboard shortcut for \"Open Daily Note\" is `alt`+`d`. This can be overridden using the [VS Code Keybindings editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings).\n\n## Configuration\n\nBy default, Daily Notes will be created in a file called `yyyy-mm-dd.md` in the workspace root, with a heading `yyyy-mm-dd`.\n\nThese settings can be overridden in your workspace or global `.vscode/settings.json` file, using the [**dateformat** date masking syntax](https://github.com/felixge/node-dateformat#mask-options):\n\n```jsonc\n  \"foam.openDailyNote.directory\": \"journal\", // a relative directory path will get appended to the workspace root.

This is done to make the content of the file compatible with various Markdown tools (e.g. parsers, static site generators, VS code plugins etc), which don't support `[[wikilinks]]`.\n\n## Example\n\nThe following example:\n\n```md\n- [[wikilinks]]\n- [[github-pages]]\n```\n\n...generates the following link reference definitions to the bottom of the file:\n\n```md\n[wikilinks]: wikilinks \"Wikilinks\"\n[github-pages]: github-pages \"GitHub Pages\"\n```\n\nYou can open the [raw markdown](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions.md) to see them at the bottom of this file\n\n## Specification\n\nThe three components of a link reference definition are `[link-label]: link-target \"Link Title\"`\n\n- **link label:** The link text to match in the surrounding markdown document. This matches the inner bracket of the double-bracketed `[[wikilink]]` notation\n- **link destination** The target of the matched link\n  - By default we generate links without extension. This can be overridden, see [Configuration](#configuration) below\n- **\"Link Title\"** Optional title for link (The Foam template has a snippet of JavaScript to replace this on the website at runtime)\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can choose to generate link reference definitions with or without file extensions, depending on the target, or to disable the generation altogether. As a rule of thumb:\n\n- Links with file extensions work better with standard markdown-based tools, such as GitHub web UI.\n- Links without file extensions work better with certain web publishing tools that treat links as literal urls and don't transform them automatically, such as the standard GitHub pages installation.\n\nBy default, Foam generates links without file extensions for legacy reasons, but this may change in future versions.\n\nYou can override this setting in your Foam workspace's `settings.json`:\n\n- `\"foam.edit.linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withoutExtensions\"` (default)\n- `\"foam.edit.linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withExtensions\"`\n- `\"foam.edit.linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"off\"`\n\n### Ignoring files\n\nSometimes, you may want to ignore certain files or folders, so that Foam doesn't generate link reference definitions to them.\n\nFor instance, if you're using a local instance of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), you may find that it writes copies of each `.md` file into a `_site` directory, which may lead to Foam generating references to them instead of the original source notes.\n\nYou can ignore the `_site` directory by adding the following to your `.vscode/settings.json`:\n\n```json\n  \"files.exclude\": {\n    \"**/_site\": true\n  },\n  \"files.watcherExclude\": {\n    \"**/_site\": true\n  },\n```\n\nAfter changing the setting in your workspace, you can run the [[workspace-janitor]] command to convert all existing definitions.\n\n[[todo]] \\_Implement a `foam.eclude\n\n## Future improvements\n\nSee [[link-reference-definition-improvements]] for further discussion on current problems and potential solutions.\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[workspace-janitor]: workspace-janitor.md \"Janitor\"\n[todo]: ../dev/todo.md \"Todo\"\n[link-reference-definition-improvements]: ../dev/link-reference-definition-improvements.md \"Link Reference Definition Improvements\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/features/note-templates/","title":"Note Templates"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Features\n  - Template\n---\n\n# Note Templates\n\nFoam supports note templates. Templates are a way to customize the starting content for your notes (instead of always starting from an empty note).\n\nNote templates are files located in the special `.foam/templates` directory.\n\n## Quickstart\n\nCreate a template:\n\n- Run the `Foam: Create New Template` command from the command palette\n- OR manually create a regular `.md` file in the `.foam/templates` directory\n\n![Create new template GIF](../assets/images/create-new-template.gif)\n\n_Theme: Ayu Light_\n\nTo create a note from a template:\n\n- Run the `Foam: Create New Note From Template` command and follow the instructions. Don't worry if you've not created a template yet! You'll be prompted to create a new template if none exist.\n- OR run the `Foam: Create New Note` command, which uses the special default template (`.foam/templates/new-note.md`, if it exists)\n\n![Create new note from template GIF](../assets/images/create-new-note-from-template.gif)\n\n_Theme: Ayu Light_\n\n## Special templates\n\n### Default template\n\nThe `.foam/templates/new-note.md` template is special in that it is the template that will be used by the `Foam: Create New Note` command.\nCustomize this template to contain content that you want included every time you create a note.\n\n### Default daily note template\n\nThe `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` template is special in that it is the template that will be used when creating daily notes (e.g. by using `Foam: Open Daily Note`).\nCustomize this template to contain content that you want included every time you create a daily note.\n\n## Variables\n\nTemplates can use all the variables available in [VS Code Snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_variables).\n\nIn addition, you can also use variables provided by Foam:\n\n| Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                             |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `FOAM_SELECTED_TEXT` | Foam will fill it with selected text when creating a new note, if any text is selected. Selected text will be replaced with a wikilink to the new note. |\n| `FOAM_TITLE`         | The title of the note. If used, Foam will prompt you to enter a title for the note.                                                                     |\n\n**Note:** neither the defaulting feature (eg. `${variable:default}`) nor the format feature (eg. `${variable/(.*)/${1:/upcase}/}`) (available to other variables) are available for these Foam-provided variables.\n\n## Metadata\n\nTemplates can also contain metadata about the templates themselves. The metadata is defined in YAML \"Frontmatter\" blocks within the templates.\n\n| Name          | Description                                                                                                                      |\n| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `filepath`    | The filepath to use when creating the new note. If the filepath is a relative filepath, it is relative to the current workspace. |\n| `name`        | A human readable name to show in the template picker.                                                                            |\n| `description` | A human readable description to show in the template picker.                                                                     |\n\nFoam-specific variables (e.g. `$FOAM_TITLE`) can be used within template metadata. However, VS Code snippet variables are ([currently](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/pull/655)) not supported.\n\n### `filepath` attribute\n\nThe `filepath` metadata attribute allows you to define a relative or absolute filepath to use when creating a note using the template.\nIf the filepath is a relative filepath, it is relative to the current workspace.\n\n**Note:** While you can make use of the `filepath` attribute in [daily note](daily-notes.md) templates (`.foam/templates/daily-note.md`), there is currently no way to have `filepath` vary based on the date. This will be improved in the future. For now, you can customize the location of daily notes using the [`foam.openDailyNote` settings](daily-notes.md).\n\n#### Example of relative `filepath`\n\nFor example, `filepath` can be used to customize `.foam/templates/new-note.md`, overriding the default `Foam: Create New Note` behaviour of opening the file in the same directory as the active file:\n\n```yaml\n---\n# This will create the note in the \"journal\" subdirectory of the current workspace,\n# regardless of which file is the active file.\nfoam_template:\n  filepath: \"journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md\"\n---\n```\n\n#### Example of absolute `filepath`\n\n`filepath` can be an absolute filepath, so that the notes get created in the same location, regardless of which file or workspace the editor currently has open.\nThe format of an absolute filepath may vary depending on the filesystem used.\n\n```yaml\n---\nfoam_template:\n  # Unix / MacOS filesystems\n  filepath: '/Users/john.smith/foam/journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md'\n\n  # Windows filesystems\n  filepath: 'C:\\Users\\john.smith\\Documents\\foam\\journal\\$FOAM_TITLE.md'\n---\n```\n\n### `name` and `description` attributes\n\nThese attributes provide a human readable name and description to be shown in the template picker (e.g. When a user uses the `Foam: Create New Note From Template` command):\n\n![Template Picker annotated with attributes](../assets/images/template-picker-annotated.png)\n\n### Adding template metadata to an existing YAML Frontmatter block\n\nIf your template already has a YAML Frontmatter block, you can add the Foam template metadata to it.\n\n#### Limitations\n\nFoam only supports adding the template metadata to _YAML_ Frontmatter blocks. If the existing Frontmatter block uses some other format (e.g. JSON), you will have to add the template metadata to its own YAML Frontmatter block.\n\nFurther, the template metadata must be provided as a [YAML block mapping](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2798057), with the attributes placed on the lines immediately following the `foam_template` line:\n\n```yaml\n---\nexisting_frontmatter: \"Existing Frontmatter block\"\nfoam_template: # this is a YAML \"Block\" mapping (\"Flow\" mappings aren't supported)\n  name: My Note Template # Attributes must be on the lines immediately following `foam_template`\n  description: This is my note template\n  filepath: `journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md`\n---\nThis is the rest of the template\n```\n\nDue to the technical limitations of parsing the complex YAML format, unless the metadata is provided this specific form, Foam is unable to correctly remove the template metadata before creating the resulting note.\n\nIf this limitation proves inconvenient to you, please let us know. We may be able to extend our parsing capabilities to cover your use case. In the meantime, you can add the template metadata without this limitation by providing it in its own YAML Frontmatter block.\n\n### Adding template metadata to its own YAML Frontmatter block\n\nYou can add the template metadata to its own YAML Frontmatter block at the start of the template:\n\n```yaml\n---\nfoam_template:\n  name: My Note Template\n  description: This is my note template\n  filepath: `journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md`\n---\nThis is the rest of the template\n```\n\nIf the note already has a Frontmatter block, a Foam-specific Frontmatter block can be added to the start of the template. The Foam-specific Frontmatter block must always be placed at the very beginning of the file, and only whitespace can separate the two Frontmatter blocks.\n\n```yaml\n---\nfoam_template:\n  name: My Note Template\n  description: This is my note template\n  filepath: `journal/$FOAM_TITLE.md`\n---\n\n---\nexisting_frontmatter: \"Existing Frontmatter block\"\n---\nThis is the rest of the template\n```\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/features/orphans/","title":"Orphans"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Orphans\n  - Features\n---\n\n# Orphans\n\nFoam helps you to find orphans: notes that have neither forward links nor backlinks.\n\nOrphans can be found in the Orphans panel.\n\nTwo settings allows you to control the behaviour of the Orphans panel:\n\n- `foam.orphans.exclude`: list of glob patterns that will be used to exclude directories.

Despite their power, Foam templates can currently only be used in very limited scenarios.\n\nThis proposal aims to address these issues by streamlining note creation and by allowing templates to be used everywhere.\n\n## Limitations of current templating\n\n### Too much friction to create a new note\n\nCreating new notes should an incredibly streamlined operation. There should be no friction to creating new notes.\n\nUnfortunately, all of the current methods for creating notes are cumbersome.\n\n#### Manual note creation (Mouse + Keyboard)\n\n1. Navigate to the directory where you want the note\n2. Click the new file button\n3. Provide a filename\n4. Manually enter the template contents you want\n\n#### Manual note creation (Keyboard)\n\n1. Navigate to the directory where you want the note\n2. `⌘N` to create a new file\n3. `⌘S` to save the file and give it a filename\n4. Manually enter the template contents you want\n\n#### Foam missing note creation\n\n1. Open an existing note in the directory where you want the note\n2. Use the wikilinks syntax to create a link to the title of the note you want to have\n3. Use `Ctrl+Click`/`F12` to create the new file\n4. Manually enter the template contents you want\n\n#### `Markdown Notes: New Note` (Keyboard)\n\n1. Navigate to the directory where you want the note\n2. `Shift+⌘P` to open the command pallette\n3. Type `New Note` until it appears in the list. Press `Enter/Return` to select it.\n4. Enter a title for the note\n5. Manually enter the template contents you want\n\n#### Foam template note creation (Keyboard)\n\n1. `Shift+⌘P` to open the command pallette\n2. Type `Create New Note From Template` until it appears in the list. Press `Enter/Return` to select it.\n3. Use the arrow keys (or type the template name) to select the template. Press `Enter/Return` to select it.\n4. Modify the filepath to match the desired directory + filename. Press `Enter/Return` to select it.\n\nAll of these steps are far too cumbersome. And only the last one allows the use of templates.\n\n### Templating of daily notes\n\nCurrently `Open Daily Note` opens an otherwise empty note, with a title defined by the `foam.openDailyNote.titleFormat` setting.\nDaily notes should be able to be fully templated as well.\n\n### Templating of filepaths\n\nAs discussed in [\"Template the filepath in `openDailyNote`\"](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/523), it would be useful to be able to specify the default filepaths of templates. For example, many people include timestamps in their filepaths.\n\n## Goal / Philosophy\n\nIn a sentence: **Creating a new note should be a single button press and should use templates.**\n\n## Proposal\n\n1. Add a new `Foam: Create New Note` that is the streamlined counterpart to the more flexible `Foam: Create New Note From Template`\n2. Use templates everywhere\n3. Add metadata into the actual templates themselves in order to template the filepaths themselves.\n\n### Summary\n\nThis can be done through a series of changes to the way that templates are implemented:\n\n1. Add a `${title}` and `${titleSlug}` template variables\n2. Add a `Foam: Create New Note` command and hotkey\n3. Change missing wikilinks to use the default template\n4. Add a metadata section to templates\n5. Add a replacement for `dateFormat`\n6. Add support for daily note templates\n7. Eliminate all `foam.openDailyNote` settings\n\nI've broken it out into these steps to show that the overall proposal can be implemented piecemeal in independent PRs that build on one another.\n\n### Add a `${title}` and `${titleSlug}` template variables\n\nWhen you use `Markdown Notes: New Note`, and give it a title, the title is formatted as a filename and also used as the title in the resulting note.\n\n**Example:**\n\nGiven the title `Living in a dream world` to `Markdown Notes: New Note`, the filename is `living-in-a-dream-world.md` and the file contents are:\n\n```markdown\n# Living in a dream world\n```\n\nWhen creating a note from a template in Foam, you should be able to use a `${title}` variable. If the template uses the `${title}` variable, the user will be prompted for a title when they create a note from a template.\n\nExample:\n\nGiven this `.foam/templates/my_template.md` template that uses the `${title}` variable:\n\n```markdown\n# ${title}\n```\n\nWhen a user asks for a new note using this template (eg. `Foam: Create New Note From Template`), VSCode will first ask the user for a title then provide it to the template, producing:\n\n```markdown\n# Living in a dream world\n```\n\nThere will also be a `${titleSlug}` variable made available, which will be the \"slugified\" version of the title (eg. `living-in-a-dream-world`). This will be useful in later steps where we want to template the filepath of a template.\n\n### Add a `Foam: Create New Note` command and hotkey\n\nInstead of using `Markdown Notes: New Note`, Foam itself will have a `Create New Note` command that creates notes using templates.\n\nThis would open use the template found at `.foam/templates/new-note.md` to create the new note.\n\n`Foam: Create New Note` will offer the fastest workflow for creating a note when you don't need customization, while `Foam: Create New Note From Template` will remain to serve a fully customizable (but slower) workflow.\n\n#### Case 1: `.foam/templates/new-note.md` doesn't exist\n\nIf `.foam/templates/new-note.md` doesn't exist, it behaves the same as `Markdown Notes: New Note`:\n\n- it would ask for a title and create the note in the current directory. It would open a note with the note containing the title.\n\n**Note:** this would use an implicit default template, making use of the `${title}` variable.\n\n#### Case 2: `.foam/templates/new-note.md` exists\n\nIf `.foam/templates/new-note.md` exists:\n\n- it asks for the note title and creates the note in the current directory\n\n**Progress:** At this point, we have a faster way to create new notes from templates.\n\n### Change missing wikilinks to use the default template\n\nClicking on a dangling/missing wikilink should be equivalent to calling `Foam: Create New Note` with the contents of the link as the title.\nThat way, creating a note by navigating to a missing note uses the default template.\n\n### Add a metadata section to templates\n\n- The `Foam: New Note` command creates a new note in the current directory. This is a sensible default that makes it quick, but lacks flexibility.\n- The `Foam: Create New Note From Template` asks the user to confirm/customize the filepath. This is more flexible but slower since there are more steps involved.\n\nBoth commands use templates. It would be nice if we could template the filepaths as well as the template contents (See [\"Template the filepath in `openDailyNote`\"](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/523) for a more in-depth discussion the benefits of filepath templating).\n\nIn order to template the filepath, there needs to be a place where metadata like this can be specified.\nI think this metadata should be stored alongside the templates themselves. That way, it can make use of all the same template variable available to the templates themselves.\n\nConceptually, adding metadata to the templates is similar to Markdown frontmatter, though the choice of exact syntax for adding this metadata will have to be done with care since the templates can contain arbitrary contents including frontmatter.\n\n#### Example\n\nA workable syntax is still to be determined.\nWhile this syntax probably doesn't work as a solution, for this example I will demonstrate the concept using a second frontmatter block:\n\n```markdown\n<!-- The below front-matter block is for foam-specific template settings -->\n\n## <!-- It is removed when the user creates a new note using this template -->\n\n<!-- The default filepath to use when using this template -->\n<!-- Relative paths are relative to the workspace, absolute paths are absolute -->\n<!-- Note that you can include VSCode snippet variables to template the path -->\n\n## filepath: `journal/${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}_${titleSlug}.md`\n\n## <!-- The actual contents of the template begin after the `---` thematic break immediately below this line-->\n\n---\n\ncreated: ${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}T${CURRENT_HOUR}:${CURRENT_MINUTE}:${CURRENT_SECOND}\ntags: []\n\n---\n\n# ${title}\n```\n\nIn this example, using this template improves the UX:\n\nIn `Foam: Create New Note` workflow, having `filepath` metadata within `.foam/templates/new-note.md` allows for control over the filepath without having to introduce any more UX steps to create a new note. It's still just a hotkey away and a title.\n\nAs we'll see, when it comes to allowing daily notes to be templated, we don't even need to use `${title}` in our template, in which case we don't we don't even need to prompt for a title.\n\nIn the `Create New Note From Template` workflow, during the step where we allow the user to customize the filepath, it will already templated according to the `filepath` in the template's metadata. This means that the user has to make fewer changes to the path, especially in cases where they want to include things like datetimes in the filenames. This makes it faster (eg. don't have to remember what day it is, and don't have to type it) and less error-prone (eg. when they accidentally type the wrong date).\n\n### Add a replacement for `dateFormat`\n\n`foam.openDailyNote.filenameFormat` uses `dateFormat()` to put the current timestamp into the daily notes filename. This is much more flexible than what is available in VSCode Snippet variables. Before daily notes are switched over to use templates, we will have to come up with another mechanism/syntax to allow for calls to `dateFormat()` within template files.\n\nThis would be especially useful in the migration of users to the new daily notes templates. For example, if `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` is unset, then we could generate an implicit template for use by `Foam: Open Daily Note`. Very roughly something like:\n\n```markdown\n<!-- The below front-matter block is for foam-specific template settings -->\n\n## <!-- It is removed when the user creates a new note using this template -->\n\n<!-- The default filepath to use when using this template -->\n<!-- Relative paths are relative to the workspace, absolute paths are absolute -->\n<!-- Note that you can include VSCode snippet variables to template the path -->\n\n## filepath: `${foam.openDailyNote.directory}/${foam.openDailyNote.filenameFormat}.${foam.openDailyNote.fileExtension}`\n\n## <!-- The actual contents of the template begin after the `---` thematic break immediately below this line-->\n\n# ${foam.openDailyNote.titleFormat}\n```\n\n### Add support for daily note templates\n\nWith the above features implemented, making daily notes use templates is simple.\n\nWe define a `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` filepath that the `Foam: Open Daily Note` command will always use to find its daily note template.\nIf `.foam/templates/daily-note.md` does not exist, it falls back to a default, implicitly defined daily notes template (which follows the default behaviour of the current `foam.openDailyNote` settings).\n\nBoth `Foam: Open Daily Note` and `Foam: Create New Note` can share all of the implementation code, with the only differences being the hotkeys used and the template filepath used.\n\nExample daily note template (again using the example syntax of the foam-specific frontmatter block):\n\n```markdown\n<!-- The below front-matter block is for foam-specific template settings -->\n\n## <!-- It is removed when the user creates a new note using this template -->\n\n<!-- The default filepath to use when using this template -->\n<!-- Relative paths are relative to the workspace, absolute paths are absolute -->\n<!-- Note that you can include VSCode snippet variables to template the path -->\n\n## filepath: `journal/${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}.md`\n\n## <!-- The actual contents of the template begin after the `---` thematic break immediately below this line-->\n\n# ${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}\n```\n\nSince there is no use of the `${title}` variable, opening the daily note behaves exactly as it does today and automatically opens the note with no further user interaction.\n\n### Eliminate all `foam.openDailyNote` settings\n\nNow that all of the functionality of the `foam.openDailyNote` settings have been obviated, these settings can be removed:\n\n- `foam.openDailyNote.directory`, `foam.openDailyNote.filenameFormat`, and `foam.openDailyNote.fileExtension` can be specified in the `filepath` metadata of the daily note template.\n- `foam.openDailyNote.titleFormat` has been replaced by the ability to fully template the daily note, including the title.\n\n## Summary: resulting behaviour\n\n### `Foam: Create New Note`\n\nA new command optimized for speedy creation of new notes. This will become the default way to create new notes. In its fastest form, it simply opens the new note with no further user interaction.\n\n### `Foam: Open Daily Note`\n\nSimplified since it no longer has its custom settings, and re-uses all the same implementation code as `Foam: Create New Note`.\nTemplates can now be used with daily notes.\n\n### Navigating to missing wikilinks\n\nNow creates the new notes using the default template. Re-uses all the same implementation code as `Foam: Create New Note`\nNow uses the contents of the wikilink as the `${title}` parameter for the template.\n\n### `Foam: Create Note From Template`\n\nAlmost the exact same as it is today. However, with `${title}` and `filepath` templating, users will have less changes to make in the filepath confirmation step.\nIt's the slower but more powerful version of `Foam: Create New Note`, allowing you to pick any template, as well as customize the filepath.\n\n## Extensions\n\nIn addition to the ideas of this proposal, there are ways we could imagine extending it. These are all \"out of scope\" for this design, but thinking about them could be useful to guide our thinking about this design.\n\n### More variables in templates\n\n`${title}` is necessary in this case to replace the functionality of `Markdown Notes: New Note`.\nHowever, one could imagine that this pattern of \"Ask the user for a value for missing variable values\" could be useful in other situations too.\nPerhaps users could even define their own (namespaced) template variables, and Foam would ask them for values to use for each when creating a note using a template that used those variables.\n\n### `defaultFilepath`\n\nBy using `defaultFilepath` instead of `filepath` in the metadata section, you could have more control over the note creation without having to fall back to the full `Create New Note From Template` workflow.\n\n- `filepath` will not ask the user for the file path, simply use the value provided (as described above)\n- `defaultFilepath` will ask the user for the file path, pre-populating the file path using `defaultFilepath`\n\nThe first allows \"one-click\" note creation, the second more customization.\nThis might not be necessary, or this might not be the right way to solve the problem. We'll see.\n\n### Arbitrary hotkey -> template mappings?\n\n`Foam: Open Daily Note` and `Foam: Create New Note` only differ by their hotkey and their default template setting.\nIs there a reason/opportunity to abstract this further and allow for users to define custom `hotkey -> template` mappings?\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/publishing/generate-gatsby-site/","title":"Generate a site using Gatsby"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Publish\n  - Gatsby\n---\n\n# Generate a site using Gatsby\n\n## Using foam-gatsby-template\n\nYou can use [foam-gatsby-template](https://github.com/mathieudutour/foam-gatsby-template) to generate a static site to host it online on GitHub or [Vercel](https://vercel.com).\n\n### Publishing your foam to GitHub pages\n\nIt comes configured with GitHub actions to auto deploy to GitHub pages when changes are pushed to your main branch.\n\n### Publishing your foam to Vercel\n\nWhen you're ready to publish, run a local build.\n\n```bash\ncd _layouts\nnpm run build\n```\n\nRemove `public` from your .gitignore file then commit and push your public folder in `_layouts` to GitHub.\n\nLog into your Vercel account.

We could provide a better publishing experience by building a bespoke static site generator (or a gatsby plugin) that's aware of Foam conventions (backlinks etc.)\n\nEventually we should probably do it, as that would unlock a huge amount of power, but we should always strive to keep it optional.\n\nAt a bare minimum, Foam repos should remain valid markdown, and should be publishable by any sufficiently complete markdown to html generation tools.\n\nWould be cool if Foam pages could be published.

The caveat is: we can't rely on GitHub Pages to host and deploy our website anymore, because the plugin we'll be using to let Jekyll support KaTeX doesn't play well together with GitHub Pages.\n\nThe alternative solution is to using [[publish-to-vercel]] for building and publishing our website, so before you start integrating KaTeX into your Foam project, please follow the instructions to host your Foam workspace on [[publish-to-vercel]] first.\n\n## Adding required plugins\n\nAdd the plugin `jekyll-katex` to your Foam workspace's `_config.yml` and `Gemfile` if you haven't done so already. For detailed instructions, please refer to the `#Adding a _config.yml` and `#Adding a Gemfile` in [[publish-to-vercel]].\n\n## Loading KaTeX JS and CSS\n\nBecause we are using KaTeX to render math, we will also need to import KaTeX's JS and CSS files from CDN. The official method to load these files is documented at: [KaTeX/KaTeX#starter-template](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX#starter-template). In our case, we will need to add the following code snippet to our `_layouts/page.html`:\n\n```html\n<!-- _layouts/page.html -->\n--- layout: default ---\n\n<link\n  rel=\"stylesheet\"\n  href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.css\"\n  integrity=\"sha384-AfEj0r4/OFrOo5t7NnNe46zW/tFgW6x/bCJG8FqQCEo3+Aro6EYUG4+cU+KJWu/X\"\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n/>\n\n<!-- The loading of KaTeX is deferred to speed up page rendering -->\n<script\n  defer\n  src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/katex.min.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha384-g7c+Jr9ZivxKLnZTDUhnkOnsh30B4H0rpLUpJ4jAIKs4fnJI+sEnkvrMWph2EDg4\"\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n></script>\n\n<!-- To automatically render math in text elements, include the auto-render extension: -->\n<script\n  defer\n  src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.12.0/dist/contrib/auto-render.min.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha384-mll67QQFJfxn0IYznZYonOWZ644AWYC+Pt2cHqMaRhXVrursRwvLnLaebdGIlYNa\"\n  crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n  onload=\"renderMathInElement(document.body);\"\n></script>\n\n<!-- ... -->\n```\n\n## Adding liquid tags to wrap page content\n\nThe plugin `jekyll-katex` focuses on rendering:\n\n- Single math equations wrapped inside `katex` liquid tags like {% raw %}`{% katex %} ... {% endkatex %}`{% endraw %}.\n- Or multiple math equations in paragraphs wrapped inside {% raw %}`{% katexmm %} ... {% endkatexmm %}`{% endraw %}.\n\nIn our case, we'll be using the latter tag to wrap our {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %}. Wrap {% raw %}`{{ content }}`{% endraw %} in the liquid tags inside `_layouts/page.html` like so:\n\n```html\n<!-- _layouts/page.html -->\n\n<!-- ... -->\n{% raw %}{% katexmm %} {{ content }} {% endkatexmm %}{% endraw %}\n<!-- ... -->\n```\n\n## Render equations in Foam's homepage as well\n\nYou may have noticed that we only made modifications to the template `_layouts/page.html`, which means that `_layouts/home.html` won't have KaTeX support. If you wan't to render math in Foam's home page, you'll need to make the same modifications to `_layouts/home.html` as well.\n\nFinally, if all goes well, then our site hosted on Vercel will support rendering math equations with KaTeX after commiting these changes to GitHub. Here's a demo of the default template with KaTeX support: [Foam Template with KaTeX support](https://foam-template.vercel.app/).\n\n[//begin]: # \"Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility\"\n[math-support-with-mathjax]: math-support-with-mathjax.md \"Math Support\"\n[publish-to-vercel]: publish-to-vercel.md \"Publish to Vercel\"\n[//end]: # \"Autogenerated link references\"\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/publishing/math-support-with-mathjax/","title":"Math Support"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\nlayout: mathjax\ntags:\n  - Publish\n---\n\n# Math Support\n\nPublished Foam pages don't support math formulas by default.

It is available as an on-premise or SaaS version. The following recipe was tested with the SaaS version, but should work the same way for the on-premise.\n\nThe following recipe is written with the assumption that you already have an [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/) project.\n\n## Setup a Foam workspace\n\n1. Generate a Foam workspace using the [foam-template project](https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template).\n2. Change the remote to a git repository in Azure DevOps (Repos -> Import a Repository -> Add Clone URL with Authentication), or copy all the files into a new Azure DevOps git repository.\n3. Define which document will be the wiki home page. To do that, create a file called `.order` in the Foam workspace root folder, with first line being the document filename without `.md` extension. For a project created from the Foam template, the file would look like this:\n\n```\nreadme\n```\n\n4. Push the repository to remote in Azure DevOps.\n\n## Publish repository to a wiki\n\n1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project in a web browser.\n2. Choose **Overview** > **Wiki**. If you don't have wikis for your project, choose **Publish code as a wiki** on welcome page.\n3. Choose repository with your Foam workspace, branch (usually `master` or `main`), folder (for workspace created from foam-template it is `/`), and wiki name, and press **Publish**.\n\nA published workspace looks like this:\n\n![Azure DevOps wiki](../assets/images/azure-devops-wiki-demo.png)\n\nThere is default table of contents pane to the left of the wiki content. Here, you'll find a list of all directories that are present in your Foam workspace, and all wiki pages. Page names are derived from files names, and they are listed in alphabetical order. You may reorder pages by adding filenames without `.md` extension to `.order` file.\n\n_Note that first entry in `.order` file defines wiki's home page._\n\n## Update wiki\n\nWhile you are pushing changes to GitHub, you won't see the wiki updated if you don't add Azure as a remote. You can push to multiple repositories simultaneously.\n\n1.  First open a terminal and check if Azure is added running: `git remote show origin`. If you don't see Azure add it in the output then follow these steps.\n2.  Rename your current remote (most likely named origin) to a different name by running: `git remote rename origin main`\n3.  You can then add the remote for your second remote repository, in this case, Azure. e.g `git remote add azure https://<YOUR_ID>@dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ID>/foam-notes/_git/foam-notes`. You can get it from: Repos->Files->Clone and copy the URL.\n4.  Now, you need to set up your origin remote to push to both of these. So run: `git config -e` and edit it.\n5.  Add the `remote origin` section to the bottom of the file with the URLs from each remote repository you'd like to push to. You'll see something like that:\n\n```bash\n[core]\n ...\n  (ignore this part)\n  ...\n[branch \"master\"]\n remote = github\n merge = refs/heads/master\n[remote \"github\"]\n url = git@github.com:username/repo.git\n fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*\n[remote \"azure\"]\n url = https://<YOUR_ID>@dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ID>/foam-notes/_git/foam-notes\n fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/azure/*\n[remote \"origin\"]\n url = git@github.com:username/repo.git\n url = https://<YOUR_ID>@dev.azure.com/<YOUR_ID>/foam-notes/_git/foam-notes\n```\n\n6.  You can then push to both repositories by: `git push origin master` or a single one using: `git push github master` or `git push azure master`\n\nFor more information, read the [Azure DevOps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/publish-repo-to-wiki).\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/publishing/publish-to-github-pages/","title":"GitHub Pages"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"---\ntags:\n  - Publish\n  - Github\n---\n\n# GitHub Pages\n\n- In VSCode workspace settings set `\"foam.edit.linkReferenceDefinitions\": \"withoutExtensions\"`\n- Execute the “Foam: Run Janitor” command from the command palette.\n- [Turn **GitHub Pages** on in your repository settings](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).\n- The default GitHub Pages template is called [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer).

This workspace is a barebone Jekyll source website, which means we can customize and install plugins just like any other Jekyll websites.\n\nAs we won't be using GitHub Pages, we will be adding a few configuration files in order to help Vercel pick up on how to build our site.\n\n### Adding a `_config.yml`\n\nFirst, we'll need to add a `_config.yml` at the root directory. This is the Jekyll configuration file. In here, we will set the site's title, theme, repository and permalink options, and also tell Jekyll what plugins to use:\n\n```yaml\n# _config.yml\ntitle: Foam\n# All the plugins we will be installing now that we won't be using GitHub Pages\nplugins:\n  - jekyll-katex # optional\n  - jekyll-default-layout\n  - jekyll-relative-links\n  - jekyll-readme-index\n  - jekyll-titles-from-headings\n  - jekyll-optional-front-matter\n# The default Jekyll theme we will be using\ntheme: jekyll-theme-primer\n# The GitHub repository that we are hosting our foam workspace from\nrepository: user/repo\n# Generate permalinks in format specified in: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/permalinks/#built-in-formats\npermalink: pretty\n```\n\nThe `theme` specifies a theme for our deployed Jekyll website. The default GitHub Pages template is called [Primer](https://github.com/pages-themes/primer). See Primer docs for how to customise html layouts and templates. We can also choose a theme if you want from places like [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/).\n\nThe `plugins` specifies a list of Jekyll plugins that we will be installing in the next section. As we won't be using GitHub Pages, we'll need to install these plugins that GitHub Pages installs for us under the hood.\n\n_If you want to use LaTeX rendered with KaTeX (which is what the plugin `jekyll-katex` does), you can specify it here. And yes, one of the benefits of deploying with Vercel is that we can use KaTeX to render LaTeX! More on: [[math-support-with-katex]]_\n\n### Adding a `Gemfile`\n\nNext up, we'll create another new file called `Gemfile` in the root directory. This is where we will let Vercel know what plugins to install when building our website.\n\nIn our `Gemfile`, we need to specify our Ruby packages:\n\n```ruby\n# Gemfile\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\ngem \"jekyll\"\ngem \"kramdown-parser-gfm\"\ngem \"jekyll-theme-primer\"\ngem \"jekyll-optional-front-matter\"\ngem \"jekyll-default-layout\"\ngem \"jekyll-relative-links\"\ngem \"jekyll-readme-index\"\ngem \"jekyll-titles-from-headings\"\ngem \"jekyll-katex\"  # Optional, the package that enables KaTeX math rendering\n```\n\n### Enable math rendering with KaTeX (optional)\n\nBesides adding the plugin `jekyll-katex` in `_config.yml` and `Gemfile`, we'll also have to follow the guides in [[math-support-with-katex]] to let our site fully support using KaTeX to render math equations.\n\n### Commiting changes to GitHub repo\n\nFinally, commit the newly created files to GitHub.\n\n## Importing project to Vercel\n\nFirst, import our foam workspace (GitHub repository) to Vercel with [Vercel's _Import Git Repository_](https://vercel.com/import/git). Paste our GitHub repo's url and Vercel will automatically pull and analyze the tool we use to deploy our website. (In our case: Jekyll.)\n\nNext, select the folder to deploy from if prompted.

It will also:\n\n- Create a folder structure for your Notebooks and Sections.\n- Process pages that are in sections at the Notebook, Section Group and 1st Nested Section Group levels.\n- Allow you you choose between putting all Images in a central '/media' folder for each notebook, or in a separate '/media' folder in each folder of the hierarchy.\n- Fix image references in the resulting .md files, generating relative references to the image files within the markdown document.\n- A title, description, and date header will be added to each file as well.\n- And more (see details at repo)!\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  Start the OneNote application. All notebooks currently loaded in [OneNote](https://getonetastic.com/download) will be converted.\n2.  It is advised that you install [Onetastic](https://getonetastic.com/download) and the attached macro, which will automatically expand any collapsed paragraphs in the notebook. They won't be exported otherwise.\n    - To install the macro, click the New Macro Button within the Onetastic Toolbar and then select File -> Import and select the .xml macro included in the release.\n    - Run the macro for each Notebook that is open\n3.  For the next sections, it is highly recommended that you use VS Code, and its embedded PowerShell terminal, as this allows you to edit and run the script, as well as check the results of the .md output all in one window.\n4.  Whatever you choose, you will need to do the following:\n\n    1. Clone the script to your computer (see [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository), if you're unfamiliar with git).\n    2. Once cloned, navigate to the repo folder. In VS Code, use File -> Add Folder to Workspace, right click on the folder in the left side bar and click [Open In Integrated Terminal](../assets/images/migrating-one-note.png).\n    3. Run the script by executing\n       `.\\ConvertOnenote2Markdown-v2`\n\n       - if you receive an error, try running this line to bypass security:\n         `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process`\n       - if you still have trouble, try running both Onenote and Powershell as an administrator.\n\n5.  It will ask you for the path to store the markdown folder structure. Please use an empty folder. If using VS Code, you might not be able to paste the filepath - right click on the blinking cursor and it will paste from clipboard. **Attention:** use a full absolute path for the destination.\n6.  Read the prompts carefully to select your desired options. If you aren't actively editing your pages in Onenote, it is HIGHLY recommended that you don't delete the intermediate word docs, as they take 80+% of the time to generate. They are stored in their own folder, out of the way. You can then quickly re-run the script with different parameters until you find what you like.\n7.  Sit back and wait until the process completes.\n8.  To stop the process at any time, press Ctrl+C.\n9.  If you like, you can inspect some of the .md files prior to completion. If you're not happy with the results, stop the process, delete the .md and re-run with different parameters.\n10.

Users less familiar with VS Code are more likely to be familiar with `/` to trigger a command menu. Experienced VS Code users may be more likely to favour the command palette.\n- We can use `TabCompletionProvider` and `snippets` and mix them (maybe) via the following VS Code setting: `\"editor.snippetSuggestions\": \"inline\" | \"top\" | \"bottom\" | \"none\"`\n- For more discussion, consult the PR [here](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/pull/192).\n\n## Simplifying Markdown Syntax\n\nSome markdown syntax is difficult for users who have never authored markdown before.

Recipes\n---\n\n# Take notes on mobile phones\n\nThis #recipe offers solutions to taking Foam notes on the go.\n\nFor the time being we have decided to not build a mobile app, but rely on third parties (see [[build-vs-assemble]]).\n\nThe most promising options are:\n\n### [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/)\n\nPros\n\n- Open source\n- Already a usable solution.\n- Provides functionality to edit, create, and browser markdown files.\n- Support journal mode, todo lists, and free writing\n- Syncs to GitHub repo\n- Supports Wikilinks\n- Supports Backlinks\n- Developer is happy to prioritize Foam compatibility\n\nCons\n\n- Doesn't generate link reference lists (but this is ok, since [[workspace-janitor]] as a GitHub action can solve this)\n- Not as sleek as Apple/Google notes, some keyboard state glitching on Android, etc.\n- Lack of control over roadmap. Established product with a paid plan, so may not be open to Foam-supportive changes and additions that don't benefit most users.\n\nVerdict: Good. By far best effort/outcome ratio would be to help improve GitJournal rather than building a [bespoke mobile app](#bespoke-mobile-app-for-foam).\n\n### GitHub Codespaces\n\nPros\n\n- Works out of the box just like the desktop app\n\nCons\n\n- not generally available quite yet\n- [Pricing](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-billing-for-codespaces)\n\nFor a quick demo, see <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI5m4Uy8_4I>.\n\nVerdict: Good. Pricing should be reasonable for taking notes on the fly. Harder to assess for people who would constantly use Foam from mobile phone.\n\n## Bespoke mobile app for Foam\n\nGiven we already have a solution, why would we spend time and effort building a bespoke mobile app?\n\n- Taking notes on the go is a key part of a good note taking process, and the process should feel effortless\n- Having a custom app could help us support key user workflows in a more Foam-specific manner\n\nIf such an app was worth building, it would have to have the following features:\n\n- Instant loading and syncing for quick notes\n- Sleek, simple, beautifully designed user experience.\n- Ability to search and navigate forward links and back links (onlly in paid GitJournal version)\n- Killer feature that makes it the best note taking tool for Foam (?)\n\nGiven the effort vs reward ratio, it's a low priority for core team, but if someone wants to work on this, we can provide support!

Download the [GistPad extension](https://aka.ms/gistpad) and then re-start Visual Studio Code\n\n1. Run the `GistPad: Sign In` command and then complete the authentication flow using your GitHub account\n\n1. Run the `GistPad: Open Repository` command and select the `Create repo from template...` or `Create private repo from template...` depending on your preference\n\n1. Select the `Foam-style wiki` template, and then specify a name for your Foam workspace (e.g. `my-foam-notes`, `johns-knowledge-base`)\n\nYour new repo will be created in your GitHub account, and the `Foam` welcome page will be automatically opened. If you already have an existing Foam workspace in GitHub, then when you run step #3 above, simply select or specify the name of the GitHub repository instead.\n\n> Note: If you have any and all feedback on how GistPad can be improved to support your Foam workflow, please don't hesitate to [let us know](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad)! 👍\n\n<img width=\"700px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87863222-c1b76180-c90d-11ea-87d9-04bee1c58a0d.png\" />\n\n## Managing your workspace\n\nOnce you've opened/created the Foam repository, it will appear in the `Repositories` view of the `GistPad` tab (the one with the little notebook icon). From this tree view, you can add/edit/delete/rename new pages, upload local files, as well as view the backlinks for each page (they appear as child notes of a page).\n\n<img width=\"250px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87234704-83a7c400-c388-11ea-90a8-2a660bef4dc5.png\" />\n\n## Editing your workspace\n\nWhen you create or open a page, you can edit the markdown content as usual, as well as [paste images](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#pasting-images-1), and create [`[[links]]` to other pages](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#links). When you type `[[`, you'll recieve auto-completion for the existing pages in your workspace, and you can also automatically create new pages by simply creating a link to it.\n\nSince you're using the Visual Studio Code markdown editor, you can benefit from all of the rich language services (e.g. syntax highlighting, header collapsing), as well as the extension ecosystem (e.g. [Emojisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense)).\n\n## Navigating your workspace\n\nWhen editing a file, you can easily navigate `[[links]]` by hovering over them to see a preview of their contents and/or `cmd+clicking` on them in order to jump to the respective page. Furthermore, when you add a link to a page, a [backlink](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#backlinks) is automatically added to it.\n\nYou can view a page's backlinks using either of the following techniques:\n\n1. Expanding the file's node in the `Repositories` tree, since it's child nodes will represent backlinks. This makes it easy to browse your pages and their backlinks in a single hierachical view.\n\n1. Opening a file, and then viewing it's backlinks list at the bottom of the editor view. This makes it easy to read a page and then see its backlinks in a contextually rich way.\n\n## Daily Pages\n\nIn addition to creating arbitrary pages, you can use GistPad for journaling or capturing [daily notes](https://github.com/vsls-contrib/gistpad#daily-pages). Simply click the calendar icon in the `Repositories` tree, which will open up the page that represents today. If the page doesn't already exist, then it will be created in the workspace before being opened.\n\n<img width=\"700px\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116461/87234721-b356cc00-c388-11ea-946a-e7f9c92258a6.png\" />\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/SUMMARY/","title":"Summary"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"# Summary\n\n- Links\n  - [Foam Template](https://github.com/theowenyoung/foam-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki)\n  - [Obsidian Template](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki)\n  - [Real World Wiki](https://wiki.owenyoung.com)\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/placeholder/","title":"This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx"},"frontmatter":{"draft":true},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: This Is a Placeholder File for Mdx\ndraft: true\ntags:\n  - gatsby-theme-primer-wiki-placeholder\n---\n"}]}}}
